# Reentry Web Server

The Reentry Web Server lets you play [Reentry - An Orbital Simulator](https://reentrygame.com/) on multiple screens. This can mean a second screen connected to your PC, another PC, a tablet, or your phone. It does this, by spinning up a small webserver on the same PC that runs the game.
